    // Multitasking :-- it is the process executing the multiple task simultaneously

    // Multiprocess:-- it is the ability of the system to run multiple processes simultaneously
    // each process has an address and memory making it heavy weight
    //


    // multiThreading:--
    // --> it is the feature of java that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a programs to maximize
    // the cpu utilizatuion.
    // each part of such program is called a thread and these thread run independenlty while sharing resources like memory.


    // --> A thread is a light weight subprocess , it is the smallest unit of executuion.

    // benefits of miltithreading :-
    //1) efficent cpu utilization
    //2) asynchronization execution
    //3)
